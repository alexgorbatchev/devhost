`devhost` routing works without the browser tooling layer. Enable `devtools` only when you want the injected overlay, service controls, annotations, or component-source navigation on top of routed local apps.

When `devtools` are enabled, routed traffic is split like this:

- `/__devhost__/*` → `devtools` control server
- `Sec-Fetch-Dest: document` requests → document injector server
- everything else → app directly

That keeps assets, HMR, fetches, SSE, and WebSockets off the injection path. The control server also owns the websocket status stream used by the injected UI.

The injected `devtools` UI mounts inside its own Shadow DOM container so its runtime styles do not leak into the host page. The devtools stylesheet is built from Tailwind v4 and shadcn-compatible CSS variables, then installed into that Shadow DOM root at runtime and in Storybook. Tailwind Preflight is scoped to that root only, not to the host document.

Routed services in the injected status panel become links automatically, and clicking one opens that service URL in a new browser tab or window by default.

The panel labels `devhost`-owned services as `managed` and externally owned services as `external`; only managed services expose restart controls.

When `[devtools.externalToolbars].enabled = true` (the default), `devhost` also detects supported third-party devtools buttons on the host page, hides the native controls, and re-renders them inside the injected overlay. The native panels themselves stay owned by the host tools.

The injected overlay is always docked on the right edge of the browser. Use `[devtools.status].position` to switch between `top-right` and `bottom-right`.

When all devtools features are disabled, `devhost` does not mount these control routes for that stack.

For annotation workflows, action configuration, and queue behavior, see [Annotations](./annotations/).

## Open component source

The shipped Go runtime supports `Alt` + `right-click` component-source navigation whenever `[devtools.editor].enabled = true`.

- When `[devtools.editor].ide = "neovim"`, `devhost` launches Neovim inside the injected xterm terminal, so `nvim` must be available on the machine running `devhost`.
- Other supported editors use their direct external-editor URL launch path instead of the embedded terminal.

Embedded terminal sessions normalize their terminal environment to `TERM=xterm-256color` and `COLORTERM=truecolor` so terminal UIs like Neovim render against the xterm.js emulator instead of inheriting incompatible host-terminal identities. Neovim component-source sessions expand to fill the available viewport when opened as a modal.
